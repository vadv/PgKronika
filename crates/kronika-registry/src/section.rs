//! The `Section` trait: the typed codec contract `#[derive(Section)]` writes.
//!
//! Generic code — a shared roundtrip test, a future typed ingest helper — works
//! over `T: Section` instead of naming each type. Runtime dispatch by `type_id`
//! does not go through this trait: it uses [`decode_any`](crate::decode_any),
//! driven by [`registry`](crate::registry), so a new section type costs one
//! registry entry and no per-type `match` (README.md, "Section Trait").
